# Retail-Inventory-Optimization-Demand-Forecasting


##  Overview
This project focuses on **retail inventory optimization and demand forecasting** using machine learning and data analysis techniques.  
It leverages a synthetic dataset with daily records of multiple stores and products, including **inventory levels, sales, promotions, weather, and holidays**.  

The project addresses:
- **Demand Forecasting**
- **Dynamic Pricing Adjustments**
- **Holiday/Promotion Impact Analysis**
- **Stockout Risk Classification**
- **Retail Inventory Optimization (Reorder Levels, Dead Stock, etc.)**
